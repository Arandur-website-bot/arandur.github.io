		<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
		<p>This is the website of J. Anthony Sterrett, Jr, known in various places as Arandur.</p>
		<p>I am a back-end software developer, currently employed at the MITRE Corporation. This website represents my first tentative experimentations with web development. Everything you see here is a work in progress, and possibly in an unfinished state. My goal is to eventually make this site look like it was written sometime after 1990.</p>
		<p>I am, however, both cheap and suspicious of web technologies, so this website will also be an experiment in how far I can push Github Pages.</p>
		<p>The entire source for this website may be found <a href="https://github.com/Arandur/arandur.github.io">here</a>. Please refrain from laughter.</p>
		<p>If you'd like, you may contact me at vl (dot) arandur (at) gmail (dot) com.</p>
